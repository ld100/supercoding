# Supercoding

I’ve been delivering real-world software projects for 20+ years — not just writing code, but architecting systems, driving business impact, and growing engineering teams. My focus isn't on hobbyist coding or open-source contributions; it's about building scalable, high-impact solutions that matter in the real world..

I don't spend my free time coding because I don't need to — my job already provides plenty of deep technical challenges. If you’re a recruiter evaluating engineers based on GitHub activity, this profile won’t tell you much. But if you're here out of curiosity—welcome!
